        docker-compose up --build 


## Deploying to GCP 

1) Open the cloudbuild.yaml file and make the following substitutions to your usecase:

        _GCP_PROJECT: '<your-project-name>'
        _GCP_REGION: 'us-east1'
        _GCP_CLOUD_RUN_NAME: 'tiny-graph'
        _DOCKER_IMAGE : 'tiny-graph-image'
        _MAX_INSTANCES: '1'
        _CONCURRENCY: '100'
        _CPUS: '1'
        _MEMORY: '256'

2) Assuming you have the requisite IAM permissions for CloudBuild,CloudRegistry and CloudRun you can then run in the top level:

    gcloud builds submit
